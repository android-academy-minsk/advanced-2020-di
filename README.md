## Application

GithubClient application which shows how to use DI frameworks like Dagger 2 and Kodein.

This application is a simple github client that helps you to load all repositories for a particular account. The main
goal of this project is to show how to use Dagger 2 and Kodein as Dependency Injection frameworks. There are 2 different
branches which show the main features of each framework separately.

This example was used to create
[presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14XCXdgPnY9GvF-FX0PYXEAv7pj16aTnoqydHGJUznnk/edit) about DI in
Android Academy Minsk. The video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_CX_WL7nIM).
